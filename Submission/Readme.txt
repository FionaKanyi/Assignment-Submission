Question Four
Branching statements in java are the statements used to jump the flow of execution from one part of a program to another.
The branching statements are mostly used inside the control statements.
Java has mainly three branching statements, i.e., continue, break, and return.
The branching statements allow us to exit from a control statement when a certain condition meet.

In Java, continue and break statements are two essential branching statements used with the control statements.
The break statement breaks or terminates the loop and transfers the control outside the loop.
The continue statement skips the current execution and pass the control to the start of the loop.
The return statement returns a value from a method and this process will be done explicitly.
